## 2. Research Experience
- **Briefly describe your research topic: **

>> The combination of SNNs and 3-D Integrated Circuits (3-D ICs), so-called 3-D stacking neuromorphic systems, can be the most advanced architecture that inherits the benefits of both computing and interconnect paradigms to save power consumption while delivering optimal performance and accuracy. However, simply shifting the SNNs into the third dimension cannot fully exploit its potential or the benefits of 3-D structures. This chapter introduces the methodology to leverage the energy efficiency ofSNNs. By stacking multiple layers of memory on top of logic circuits, the weights of SNNs can be split into several subsets. Each of them is placed in different isolated layers. Hence, various low-power techniques such as power gating, dynamic voltage frequency scaling, or dynamic voltage scaling can be easily applied to each separated layer depending on the importance of the training weight’s bits. Although lowering supply voltage tends to reduce the accuracy of neural networks, with the support of 3-D structures, the performance of SNNs can be controlled or unchanged compared to normal operations when low-power techniques are used.

- **What were your key research contributions?**
>> A novel low-power methodology to implement neuromorphic architectures with 3-D stacking synaptic memory, where the memory word is split into multiple subsets and placed in separate layers.
>> With 3-D IC-based technologies, the under-voltage technique is applied separately to each memory layer in 3-D architecture based on the significant bits of synaptic weights. It aims to reduce overall power consumption with acceptable accuracy.
>> Consequently, an in-situ dynamic quantization for synaptic weight is implemented in this work as the next level of undervolting. The weights are configured in the design phase and stay unchanged during inference. Therefore, the bit precision of synaptic weights is dynamically modified by removing completely the supply voltage of memory layer(s).
>> A novel stacking memory mechanism that helps improve the yield rates by accepting imperfection at the top layers.
